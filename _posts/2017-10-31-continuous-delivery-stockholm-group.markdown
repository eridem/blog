Last October 31st 2017, I did a speech about using [Hashicorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to provisioning our infrastructure.

It was in the [Continuous Delivery Stockholm Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Continuous-Delivery-Stockholm/events/244138266/).

You can download the original presentation from [here](https://github.com/eridem/blog/raw/master/attachments/2017-10-31-continuous-delivery-stockholm-group.pdf)
