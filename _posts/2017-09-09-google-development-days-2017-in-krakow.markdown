Last 5th September 2017, I assisted to the Google Developer Days Europe in Kraków.

My main interest were sessions related with AI and Cloud. Google speachers explain how TensorFlow is accessible even more to developers and how AI is involved in all their products. Other updates were related with Google Cloud to offer similar solutions to AWS and Azure to compare.
